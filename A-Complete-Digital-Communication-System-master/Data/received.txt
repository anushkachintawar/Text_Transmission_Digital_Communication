In twilight's hue, the stars ignite,Their whispers weave through darkest night.A moonbeam's dance, a silent vow,Nature's symphony, then takes its bow.The rustling leaves, a whispered song,Echoes of a world that's strong.Mountains stand in stoic grace,Guardians of this wondrous space.Life's fleeting moments, a precious art,Painted on the canvas of the heart.Love's gentle touch, a guiding flame,In every soul, it leaves its claim.So let us cherish, while we may,This fleeting beauty, day by day.For in this tapestry we share,Lies the essence of our tender care.
